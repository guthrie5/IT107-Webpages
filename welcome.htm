            <p>A little happy sunlight shining through there. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of
            Prussian blue Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Maybe he has a little friend that lives
            right over here. Don't be bashful drop me a line. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it
            is.

            Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. You can't make a mistake. Anything that
            happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Have fun with it. Just beat the devil
            out of it.

            And maybe a little bush lives there. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. This is the way
            you take out your flustrations. There comes a nice little fluffer. This is the time to get out all your
            flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. It's cold, but
            it's beautiful.</p>

            <p>If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Paint
            anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're
            doing the wrong thing.

            Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Just take
            out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Everything is happy if you choose to make it
            that way. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.

            I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. By now you should be quite happy about what's
            happening here. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. If you do too much it's going to lose its
            effectiveness. That's crazy.

            See there, told you that would be easy. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic
            dividends. We can fix anything. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. I like to beat the
            brush.</p>
